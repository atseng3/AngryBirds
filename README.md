# Angry Birds Flight Path
This is my solution to finding the optimum path that an angry bird can take to get to his destination while riding on jetstreams

The solution is written in Ruby, please run "ruby solution.rb" to see the results.

Feel free to add new streams to jetstreams.txt to test it.

### Explanation
My solution is implemented with a class called AngryBirdFlight that handles parsing "jetstreams.txt", building a multi-children Tree, and searching through this tree for the optimum path.
